## General Notes and Guidance
I have created 3 files, one for PVE rolls, one for PVP rolls, and one for particularly terrible rolls that you can immediately delete. I would like to keep them separate to identify which rolls are good for what gameplay, without needing to exhaustively comment every entry.

Each file is plain text, and can be edited directly from the git webbrowser, or send them to Tyler in whatever way and I'll manaully add them. 

My suggestions on requirements are:

- Add any Roll you would feel bad deleting 
- Only add the perks for a given roll that are required to make it great. if the 1/2 cols don't really matter... don't specify them
- If there are particular weapons that are just bad... we should add them to the poop file.

## How to add to DIM:
- click the Gear in the top right
- scroll down to wishlists
- copy the RAW URL for the file you want to use (copied below for ease of use)
- Click Add Wish List
- the total count of wish list rolls should increase

## Current Issues
- sometimes weapons don't seem to populate the "thumbs up" icon at their top DIM interface level... I'm not sure why. If you click the weapon the individual perks show a thumbs up, but the weapon as a whole does not. IDK, I'm looking into it.
